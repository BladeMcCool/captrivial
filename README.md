# CapTrivia: A Pulley Coding Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to CapTrivia, a unique coding challenge designed by Pulley to assess the skills and creativity of prospective software engineers. This project encompasses a simple trivia application and serves as a platform for candidates to demonstrate their abilities in a real-world scenario.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Written in Go.
- **Frontend**: Developed using React.
- **Database**: Postgres (integrated via Docker Compose but not yet utilized).

Upon launching, CapTrivia operates as a single-player trivia game. Currently, it includes 20 sample trivia questions. Players can view their scores after participating.

## Your Mission

Your task is to explore, analyze, and enhance CapTrivia. The code quality is intentionally imperfect, offering ample opportunities for improvement and innovation. You're encouraged to approach this project as you would a typical day at Pulley - using any tools, resources, and methodologies at your disposal.

### Possible Extensions

1. **Multiplayer Functionality**: Transform CapTrivia into a multiplayer experience. Players should be able to start a game, invite friends via a link, and compete in real-time.

2. **Aesthetic Overhaul**: The UI/UX of CapTrivia is basic. We invite you to revamp it, showcasing your skills in creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces.

3. **Code Refinement**: Assess the existing codebase for potential improvements in efficiency, structure, and readability.

4. **Incorporate the Database**: Utilize the Postgres database to enhance the application's functionality.

## Guidelines

- Spend time before the interview to understand and extend the project.
- During the 60-minute coding interview, continue to develop the application, focusing on areas you've identified as key improvement points.
- As much as possible, we're trying to make this a simulation of a normal day on the job. To that end, feel free to do anything you'd normally do to work efficiently -- pull in open source packages, use Github Copilot/ChatGPT, etc.

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll assess your work based on:

- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and efficient code.
- **Problem Solving**: Effectiveness in identifying and addressing the project's shortcomings.
- **Creativity and Innovation**: How you enhance the application's functionality and user experience.
- **Use of Tools and Resources**: Effective use of available tools and resources to aid in your development process.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your version of CapTrivia!
